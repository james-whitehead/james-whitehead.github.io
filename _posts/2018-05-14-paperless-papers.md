Sometimes you stumble upon two articles, connected but written separately, that form a greater whole. This was the case for [The Scientific Paper is Obselete](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/ "The Scientific Paper is Obsolete") and [Design for an Audience](http://style.org/ku/ "Design for an Audience"), the former by a science writer for The Atlantic and the latter by a science graphics designer for The New York Times. They're both well worth a read and are written much better than what's about to be written here, but for brevity's sake, here's a quote from each that sums up what they're about.

> Scientific results today are as often as not found with the help of computers. That’s because the ideas are complex, dynamic, hard to grab ahold of in your mind’s eye. And yet by far the most popular tool we have for communicating these results is the PDF - literally a simulation of a piece of paper. Maybe we can do better.

> The charts that made it into the paper - a Nobel Prize winning paper - are incredibly difficult for me to understand. I remember looking at this and thinking: "How am I ever going to explain this to the public, to my audience?"
> -Jonathan Corum, The New York Times

The collective statements made in the articles are as follows:

* [Paper is 2200 years old.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_paper "History of paper") [The printing press is almost 600.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press "Printing press") We still use them (or some form of them) as the primary methods of scientific communication.
* The confines of paper means text and graphics have to be condensed and compressed.
* We can use the freer layouts and multimedia of the internet to make scientific papers more accessible to a wide range of people on a wider range of devices.

I'm not a writer or a designer, which makes me the perfect person to put these ideas into more practice. It also makes me the worst person because the end result will likely be more confusing than the original paper, but it's worth a go.

I also stumbled across an article about [the most cited sources on Wikipedia,](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/04/05/ten-most-cited-sources-wikipedia/ "What are the ten most cited sources on Wikipedia?"), so I thought the best paper to try and demystify would be the most popular: 'Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification' (2007). I'd recommend you read [the PDF of it first](https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.pdf "Updated world map of the Koppen-Geiger climate classification") to better see how my attempts stack up.

## Updated World Map of the Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification

### Abstract

Although now over 100 years old, the classification of climate originally formulated by Wladimir Köppen and modified by his collaborators and successors, is still in widespread use. It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate courses on climate. It is also still in regular use by researchers across a range of disciplines as a basis for climatic regionalisation of variables and for assessing the output of global climate models. Here we have produced a new global map of climate using the Köppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station time series.

Climatic variables used in the Köppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spine with tension onto a  0.1◦×0.1◦ grid for each continent.

We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the Köppen-Geiger system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis.

Globally the most common climate type by land area is BWh (14.2%, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5%, Tropical savannah). The updated world Köppen-Geiger climate map is freely available electronically in the [Supplementary Material Section.](http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007-supplement.zip "Supplementary Material Section")

### Introduction

The climate classification is based on the work of Wladimir Köppen, and dating from 1900, continues to be the most widely used climate classification over a century later.
