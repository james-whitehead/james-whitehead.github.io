Sometimes you stumble upon two articles, connected but written separately, that form a greater whole. This was the case for [The Scientific Paper is Obsolete](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/) and [Design for an Audience](http://style.org/ku/), the former by a science writer for The Atlantic and the latter by a science graphics designer for The New York Times. They're both well worth a read and are written much better than what's about to be written here, but for brevity's sake, here's a quote from each that sums up what they're about.

> Scientific results today are as often as not found with the help of computers. That’s because the ideas are complex, dynamic, hard to grab ahold of in your mind’s eye. And yet by far the most popular tool we have for communicating these results is the PDF - literally a simulation of a piece of paper. Maybe we can do better.
> The Scientific Paper is Obsolete (James Somers, The Atlantic)

> The charts that made it into the paper - a Nobel Prize winning paper - are incredibly difficult for me to understand. I remember looking at this and thinking: "How am I ever going to explain this to the public, to my audience?"
> Design for an Audience (Jonathan Corum, The New York Times)

The collective statements made in the articles are as follows:

* [Paper is 2200 years old.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_paper) [The printing press is almost 600.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press) We still use them (or some form of them) as the primary methods of scientific communication.
* The confines of paper means text and graphics have to be condensed and compressed.
* We can use the freer layouts and multimedia of the internet to make scientific papers more accessible to a wide range of people on a wider range of devices.

I'm not a writer or a designer, which makes me the perfect person to put these ideas into more practice. It also makes me the worst person because the end result will likely be more confusing than the original paper, but it's worth a go.

I also stumbled across an article about [the most cited sources on Wikipedia](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/04/05/ten-most-cited-sources-wikipedia/), so I thought the best paper to try and demystify would be the most popular: 'Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification' (2007). I'd recommend you read [the PDF of it first](https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.pdf) to better see how my attempts stack up.

## Updated World Map of the Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification

### Abstract

Although now over 100 years old, the classification of climate originally formulated by Wladimir Köppen and modified by his collaborators and successors, is still in widespread use. It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate courses on climate. It is also still in regular use by researchers across a range of disciplines as a basis for climatic regionalisation of variables and for assessing the output of global climate models. Here we have produced a new global map of climate using the Köppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station time series.

Climatic variables used in the Köppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spine with tension onto a  0.1°×0.1° grid for each continent.

We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the Köppen-Geiger system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis.

Globally the most common climate type by land area is BWh (14.2%, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5%, Tropical savannah). The updated world Köppen-Geiger climate map is freely available electronically in the [Supplementary Material Section.](http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007-supplement.zip)

### Introduction

The climate classification is based on the work of Wladimir Köppen, and dating from 1900, continues to be the most widely used climate classification over a century later. Essenwanger (2001) has provided a comprehensive review of the classification of climate from prior to Köppen through to the present. The period of greatest activity was from the mid-nineteenth century through to the 1950s. What is somewhat surprising about this time profile of activity is that as both the availability of data and computing power to process them has become increasingly widely available post-1960, the level of activity in the development of new climate classifications has markedly declined. The continued popularity and widespread use of the Köppen classification is remarkable.

There is no doubt an element of historical inertia in this as each generation of students it taught global climate using this system and it is the basis of most common global climate maps. To replace it with a new system would be a significant task. Arthur Wilcox (1968) [^1] was probably correct in surmising:

> If ... one is convinced that there are in principle strict limits to what can be achieved by any simple classification, one may consider it profitless to seek minor improvements at the cost of confusion.

Köppen's inspiration for developing a world map of climate classification in 1900 owed much to the global vegetation map of Grisebach published in 1886 and Köppen's own background in plant sciences. [^1]

Thornthwaite (1943) [^2] claims that Köppen's use of the first five letters of the alphabet to label his climate zones is taken from the five vegetation groups delineated by the late nineteenth century French/Swiss botanist Alphonse De Candolle who in turn based these on the climate zones of the ancient Greeks. It is inconceivable that Köppen could have produced his original classification and mao without using other landscape signals of climate (particularly vegetation) since there would have been so little observed climate data available at that time.

In Fig. 3 of this paper we show the relative number of stations with temperature and precipitation data starting from 1800. Compared with what is available now, there would have been data from few stations available to Köppen and the global distribution would have been much more inconsistent than is the case now. In the light of this, the persistence of his scheme of classification is even more remarkable.

While Sanderson (1999) [^3] has argued that it is time for modern atmospheric scientists to develop a new classification of climates, the Köppen classification continues to be the one most widely used in teaching. If we take as an example the textbooks of Arthur Strahler that are in very wide use in the English speaking world, it is the case that despite Strahler's own attempt to produce a new climate classification (see, for example, Strahler, 1971 [^4]) the latest edition of this series of texts still uses the Köppen system (Strahler and Strahler, 2005). [^5]

The use of Köppen's classification is not confined to teaching. Many researches routinely use it for their own particular research purposes. The present authors have used it as the basis for grouping rivers by climate type around the world in order to facilitate comparisons of runoff characteristics (McMahon et al., 1992; [^6] Peel et al., 2004 [^7]). Lohmann et al. (1993) [^8] have applied the Köppen classification to the output from both atmosphere general circulation models and coupled atmosphere-ocean circulation models and compared these to maps of the Köppen classification using modern data sets and to Köppen's 1923 map. They modelled both present conditions and enhanced greenhouse scenarios and concluded:

>However, the Köppen classification is easier to apply and is still a useful tool for estimating the ability of climate models to reproduce the present climate as well as indicate the impact of climate changes on the biosphere.

No doubt Köppen would have been pleased with this assessment.
